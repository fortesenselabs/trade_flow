# Venues

**Venues** are the connections between TradeFlow and external trading environments. They consist of two primary components:

- **Data Client:** Responsible for acquiring market data from exchanges or brokers.
- **Execution Client:** Handles order placement and management on trading platforms.

By utilizing data clients and execution clients, TradeFlow can efficiently interact with various trading venues to execute automated trading strategies.
