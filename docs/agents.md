# Agents

In the context of TradeFlow, an **agent** is an autonomous decision-making entity responsible for executing trading strategies. It interacts with the trading environment (market) by observing market data, making trading decisions, and executing orders.

## Key Components of a TradeFlow Agent

1. **Perception:**
   - Receives market data (prices, volumes, indicators) from the environment.
   - Processes and interprets data to extract relevant information.
2. **Decision Making:**
   - Employs trading strategies and algorithms to analyze market conditions.
   - Determines optimal actions (buy, sell, hold) based on the current state.
3. **Execution:**
   - Sends trading orders to the execution platform.
   - Manages order lifecycle (placement, modification, cancellation).
4. **Learning (Optional):**
   - For reinforcement learning-based agents, continuously learns from trading experiences to improve performance.

## Types of TradeFlow Agents

1. **Rule-Based Agent:**
   - Follows predefined trading rules and conditions.
   - Typically simpler to implement but less adaptable to changing market conditions.
2. **Algorithmic Agent:**
   - Employs advanced algorithms (e.g., moving averages, RSI, Bollinger Bands) for decision making.
   - Offers more flexibility than rule-based agents.
3. **Machine Learning Agent:**
   - Leverages machine learning techniques (e.g., decision trees, neural networks) to learn from historical data and make predictions.
   - Can adapt to complex market patterns and potentially outperform traditional methods.
4. **Reinforcement Learning Agent:**
   - Learns optimal trading strategies through interaction with the environment.
   - Requires extensive training but can achieve high performance in dynamic markets.

## Agent Architecture (Optional)

A typical TradeFlow agent can be structured as follows:

```python
class Agent:
    def __init__(self, environment, strategy):
        self.environment = environment
        self.strategy = strategy

    def perceive(self):
        # Observe market data from environment
        pass

    def decide(self):
        # Make trading decision based on strategy and observations
        pass

    def act(self):
        # Execute trading order
        pass

    def learn(self):
        # Update agent's knowledge based on experience (optional)
        pass
```

## Agent Evaluation

To assess agent performance, key metrics such as:

- Profit and loss
- Sharpe ratio
- Maximum drawdown
- Win rate
- Average holding period
  should be considered.
