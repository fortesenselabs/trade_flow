## Milestones

Ansible: For provisioning MetaTrader platforms automatically. (Optional for now)

Nautilus Trader Adapter: For connecting Nautilus to MetaTrader. (1)

TradeFlow: Infrastructure for running multiple trading nodes(based on nautilus) and agents (This is the platform we want to build and to be honest we can do it along with the adapter for now, then later we would push it out as a standalone package)

Trading Agent: The trained agent that makes decisions. (To be built on after of the Nautilus Adapter and simulated training environment) (3)
