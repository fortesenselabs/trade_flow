# Project Roadmap

## **Phase 1: Foundation and Training Node**

1. **Node Development:**
   - Inherit from NautilusTrader's TradingNode to provide a robust foundation for real-time trading(called `LiveNode`).
   - Integrate the Nautilus backtest engine and RL gymnasium environment to create a comprehensive training environment(called `TrainingNode`, look at the backtest Node for reference).
   - Implement necessary features for data handling, market simulation, and agent interaction.

## **Phase 2: Agent Development**

1. **Agent Design:**
   - Define the agent's architecture, including its decision-making process and learning mechanisms.
   - Inherit from Nautilus trader's Actor and a defined Agent Interface to ensure compatibility and leverage existing functionalities.
2. **Agent Training:**
   - Train the agent using the TrainingNode environment and appropriate reinforcement learning algorithms.
   - Experiment with different hyperparameters and training strategies to optimize performance.

## **Phase 3: Strategies and Adaptation**

1. **Strategy Development:**
   - Create or adapt strategies from Nautilus trader's library, incorporating ActionScheme and RewardScheme to align with the agent's decision-making process.
   - Consider factors such as risk management, reward functions, and trading objectives.
2. **Strategy Optimization:**
   - Fine-tune strategies based on agent performance and market conditions.
   - Explore techniques like backtesting and parameter tuning to improve strategy effectiveness.

## **Phase 4: Integration and Testing**

1. **MetaTrader 5 Adapter Integration:**
   - Connect the Nautilus Trader framework to MetaTrader 5 using the adapter.
   - Ensure seamless data exchange and execution of trades through the MetaTrader 5 platform.
2. **Comprehensive Testing:**
   - Conduct rigorous testing of the entire system, including agent performance, strategy effectiveness, and risk management.
   - Simulate various market scenarios and evaluate the system's ability to adapt and respond to changing conditions.

## **Phase 5: Deployment and Monitoring**

1. **Deployment:**
   - Deploy the trained agent and strategies to a production environment.
   - Set up necessary infrastructure and configurations for real-time trading.
2. **Monitoring and Maintenance:**
   - Continuously monitor the agent's performance and system health.
   - Implement mechanisms for risk management and early warning systems.
   - Regularly update and maintain the system to adapt to evolving market conditions and technological advancements.
