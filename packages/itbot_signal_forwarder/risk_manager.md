# Documentation on Conservative and Aggressive Strategies in Risk Management

The `RiskManager` class in the trading bot provides a flexible risk management system that supports multiple strategies for calculating position sizes and managing risk. Two primary approaches can be applied across these strategies depending on the trader's risk tolerance: **Conservative** and **Aggressive** strategies.

### 1. Conservative Strategy

The conservative strategy focuses on minimizing risk and protecting the trader's capital. This approach typically includes the following characteristics:

- **Smaller Position Sizes**: Allocate a smaller percentage of the current balance to each trade, ensuring that losses remain manageable.
- **Drawdown Management**: Aggressively reduces risk during drawdown periods by scaling down position sizes when the current equity is lower than previous highs.
- **Focus on Long-Term Stability**: Prioritizes steady, lower-risk returns over a longer period of time.
- **Reduced Leverage**: Tends to avoid high leverage to minimize exposure to sudden market fluctuations.
- **Tighter Stop-Losses**: Uses tighter stop-loss orders to limit potential losses quickly.

The conservative strategy is ideal for traders who value stability and aim to preserve their capital even at the expense of smaller returns. Implementations in the `RiskManager` class include:

- **Fixed Percentage Strategy**: Allocates a fixed, relatively low percentage (e.g., 1-2%) of the balance to each trade.
- **Mean Reversion Strategy**: Uses tighter control on position sizes when prices deviate from the mean, reducing position size in volatile conditions.
- **Volatility-Based Strategy**: Reduces position sizes in high volatility markets, calculated inversely to the ATR value.
- **Equity Curve Strategy**: Aggressively scales down risk during drawdowns to preserve capital.

### 2. Aggressive Strategy

The aggressive strategy aims to maximize profit potential by taking on higher risks. This approach typically includes the following characteristics:

- **Larger Position Sizes**: Allocates a higher percentage of the balance to each trade, leading to potentially larger gains but also higher potential losses.
- **Increased Leverage**: Uses higher leverage to amplify returns, accepting the associated risk.
- **Drawdown Recovery**: Less stringent drawdown management, allowing for larger positions to be taken even after losses in anticipation of a quick recovery.
- **Focus on Short-Term Gains**: Prioritizes rapid, high-risk returns over short periods of time.
- **Wider Stop-Losses**: Allows for wider stop-loss orders to accommodate short-term price fluctuations, accepting the risk of larger drawdowns.

The aggressive strategy suits traders who are willing to take on substantial risk in pursuit of higher rewards. Implementations in the `RiskManager` class include:

- **Kelly Criterion Strategy**: Uses the Kelly criterion formula to determine an optimal, higher-risk position size based on win probability and reward-to-risk ratios.
- **Martingale Strategy**: Doubles position size after each loss, assuming a reversion to mean profitability, making it highly aggressive in nature.
- **Equity Curve Strategy**: Scales up risk aggressively during periods of profitability, leveraging a higher equity curve to potentially achieve rapid returns.

### Usage of Strategies in the RiskManager Class

The `RiskManager` class enables dynamic selection and switching of these strategies through the `select_strategy()` method. By adjusting parameters such as the `risk_percentage`, `drawdown_factor`, and `profit_factor`, users can customize each strategy to align with their risk tolerance.

For instance, setting a high `risk_percentage` and a high `profit_factor` would yield an aggressive variant of any strategy, while a low `risk_percentage` with a higher `drawdown_factor` would configure a conservative approach.

### Strategy Implementation Examples

#### Conservative Example: Fixed Percentage Strategy

```python
# Create a RiskManager instance with a conservative risk percentage of 1%.
risk_manager = RiskManager(initial_balance=10000, risk_percentage=1.0)
risk_manager.select_strategy("fixed_percentage")
position_size = risk_manager.calculate_position_size()
print(f"Conservative Fixed Percentage Position Size: {position_size}")
```

#### Aggressive Example: Kelly Criterion Strategy

```python
# Create a RiskManager instance with a higher risk percentage.
risk_manager = RiskManager(initial_balance=10000, risk_percentage=5.0)
risk_manager.select_strategy("kelly_criterion")
# Assuming a win probability of 60% and a reward-risk ratio of 2.0.
position_size = risk_manager.calculate_position_size(win_probability=0.6, reward_risk_ratio=2.0)
print(f"Aggressive Kelly Criterion Position Size: {position_size}")
```

In both cases, the `calculate_position_size` method adjusts the position size dynamically based on the selected strategy and account balance, making the `RiskManager` adaptable for different trading styles and market conditions.
