    "The project is aimed at developing an intelligent trading bot for automated trading cryptocurrencies(we would have to make it support forex and stocks too) using state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) algorithms and feature engineering. The project provides the following major functionalities:\n",
    "* Defining derived features using custom (Python) functions including technical indicators\n",
    "* Analyzing historic data and training machine learning models in batch off-line mode\n",
    "* Analyzing the predicted scores and choosing best signal parameters\n",
    "* Signaling service which is regularly requests new data from the exchange and generates buy-sell signals by applying the previously trained models in on-line mode\n",
    "* Trading service which does real trading by buying or selling the assets according to the generated signals\n",
